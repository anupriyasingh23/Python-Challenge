# Python-Challenge
In this assignment, you will tackle two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll. These challenges will allow you to apply the Python programming concepts you have learned so far and demonstrate your skills in real-world scenarios.

Before You Begin
Before starting the assignment, make sure to follow these steps:

Create a new repository called python-challenge for this project. Avoid adding this assignment to an existing repository.

Clone the newly created repository to your local computer.

Inside your local Git repository, create two folders named PyBank and PyPoll for each Python assignment.

Add the following content to each folder:

Create a new file named main.py in each folder. This will serve as the main script for running the analysis.

Include a Resources folder in each folder that contains the CSV files required for the analysis. Ensure that your script has the correct path to access the CSV files.

Add an analysis folder to each folder, which should contain a text file with the results from your analysis.

Push these changes to GitHub or GitLab to store your progress.

Files
To help you get started, you can download the necessary files for the challenges from the following link:

Module 3 Challenge files - Contains the required data files for the challenges.
PyBank Instructions
In the PyBank challenge, you will analyze the financial records of a company. The provided dataset, budget_data.csv, consists of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

Your task is to create a Python script that performs the following calculations based on the records:

Determine the total number of months included in the dataset.

Calculate the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.

Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period and find the average of those changes.

Identify the greatest increase in profits (including the date and amount) over the entire period.

Identify the greatest decrease in profits (including the date and amount) over the entire period.

PyPoll Instructions
The PyPoll challenge involves modernizing the vote-counting process for a small rural town. You will be provided with a dataset named election_data.csv, which contains three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate".

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates the following information:

Determine the total number of votes cast.

Generate a complete list of candidates who received votes.

Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.

Determine the total number of votes each candidate won.

Identify the winner of the election based on the popular vote.
